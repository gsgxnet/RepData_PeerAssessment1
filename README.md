## Introduction

This repository contains my submission for assessment 1 of Course 5
Reproducible Research of the coursera 
John Hopkins Data Science Specialization.

This is a fork of the course authors repository found at 
**[github](http://github.com/rdpeng/RepData_PeerAssessment1)**

A detailed description of the task can be found in the original README.md of the forked repo as
**[README_original](https://github.com/gsgxnet/RepData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/README_original.md)**

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring
device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the
day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous
individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012
and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

## Data

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web
site:

* Dataset: [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52K]

The variables included in this dataset are:

* **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing
    values are coded as `NA`)

* **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD
    format

* **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which
    measurement was taken


The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there
are a total of 17,568 observations in this
dataset.


NOTE: The GitHub repository also contains the dataset for the
assignment so you do not have to download the data separately.

## Result

The assignments work is stored in a new version of the file: [PA1_template.Rmd](https://github.com/gsgxnet/RepData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/PA1_template.Rmd)
